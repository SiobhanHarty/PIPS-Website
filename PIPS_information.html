<p>Thank you for expressing interest in our study. Please read the information about the study and what your participation will entail below. If you are still interested in participating once you have read this information please click on the ‘continue’ button to proceed to the consent form.</p>
<br>
<p><b>What are the objectives of the study?</b></p>

<p>We are interested in finding out why antidepressant drugs work for some people and not for others. By following a large group of individuals as they go through an 8-week course of treatment, we aim to find measurements that can predict who will get better.</p>
<p>The hope is that if we can find reliable and specific predictors of antidepressant treatment response, we can move towards a more personalised approach to mental health treatment - matching the right treatment with the right person. </p>

<p>Payments will be made in Euro and converted to your local currency at an exchange rate determined by the company managing payment (Paypal or Amazon). Payments will be processed via your choice of Paypal or an Amazon electronic gift card. <u>You must be able to accept payment via one of these methods to be included in the study</u>, as payment cannot be made in any other form. Payments at each stage will be made as soon as possible, but in busy periods could take up to 5 business days.</p>

<p class ="HRstar" style= "text-align: center; padding: 6px;">*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************</p>

<p><b>Are there any risks involved in participating?</b></p>

<p>The risks associated with participating in this study are <u>minimal</u>. However, it is possible that you might find the sensitive nature of the questions upsetting. In particular, we would like to advise you that one of the questionnaires will require you to indicate whether or not you experienced any abuse (physical or sexual), trauma, or neglect during your childhood. Before agreeing to participate, we would like you to consider whether you will be willing to answer these potentially sensitive questions. We will provide information about international resources, comprising links to useful support services, websites and hotlines that you can access if you find these questions upsetting.</p>

<p>Most importantly, this study is <i>naturalistic</i> in design. That means that we collect measurements from participants as they go about their lives as normal, without interference. If you decide to change your treatment mid-way through this study or decide to stop taking your treatment entirely, this does not affect your participation in this study in any way - you can continue to the end as receive payment as usual. <u>We are just as interested in people who decide to stop taking treatment as we are in people who take it all the way through</u>. All we ask is that you keep us up to date on what you are taking each week!</p>

<p class ="HRstar" style= "text-align: center; padding: 6px;">*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************</p>

<p><b>Are there any benefits to participating?</b></p>

<p>This study will not benefit you in any direct way therapeutically. The only direct benefit is the token payment of €60 that you will receive for completing the study in full. However, we hope to use your data to develop a tool that can match specific treatments to specific individuals in the future, and in that way your contribution might benefit others.</p>

<p class ="HRstar" style= "text-align: center; padding: 6px;">*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************</p>

<p><b>Will the research team take responsibility for monitoring my treatment and care?</b></p>

<p>No. The researchers conducting this study are not responsible for monitoring your treatment or changes in my mental health status, e.g. worsening of symptoms. The prescribing clinician should be contacted with all questions pertaining to your continued care, including any adverse effects associated with taking antidepressant medication and decisions regarding continuation or cessation of treatment. The research team will never interfere with or monitor treatment in any way, and will never provide advice about your care.</p>

<p><b>What happens if I decide not to participate or leave the study early?</b></p>

<p>It is entirely your choice whether you participate in the study. If you leave the study before finishing all portions, you will only be paid for the segments completed according to the payment schedule above. For example, if you leave the study at week 3, you will be paid a total of €10, if you leave the study at week 6, you will be paid a total of €30. You can choose to withdraw your data at the conclusion of your participation if you so wish, up until the point that my data has been analysed and a report based on the data has been submitted.</p>

<p class ="HRstar" style= "text-align: center; padding: 6px;">*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************</p>

<p><b>What will happen to my data?</b></p>

<p>Information from this study will be kept strictly confidential and no identifiable information (i.e. your name, contact information, or date of birth) will be made available to any person outside the research group. Your personal information will be stored in anonymised, encrypted form in a password-protected computer. We will aim to present and publish our results in conferences and scientific journals and to share the raw anonymised data collected in this study with other researchers for follow-up analyses. This will be done by linking your data to a unique study ID, with all identifiable information removed - specifically your name, contact information, and date of birth will be removed. Under the Freedom of Information Act 2014, you will have access to any information stored about you in relation to the current study for up to 10 years after you provided it.</p>
