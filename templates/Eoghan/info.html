Before agreeing to participate, we would like you to consider whether you will be willing to answer these potentially sensitive questions. We will provide information about international resources, links to useful support services, websites and hotlines that you can access if you find these questions upsetting.<p>

We are just as interested in people who decide to stop taking treatment as we are in people who take it all the way through.
